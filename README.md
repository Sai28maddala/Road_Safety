# Road Safety and E-Speed Breakers

## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing road safety through the development and implementation of **E-Speed Breakers**. The goal is to reduce accidents caused by speeding, improve traffic flow, and ensure safer roads for everyone. The project leverages innovative technology like radar systems, RFID, and sensors to enforce speed limits and promote responsible driving behavior.

## Features

- **Autonomous Speed Adjustment**: Ensures vehicles maintain safe speeds.
- **Traffic Flow Enhancement**: Reduces congestion and improves organization.
- **Driver Safety Measures**: Reduces risks by enforcing speed limits and providing road condition feedback.
- **Dedicated Safety Infrastructure**: Promotes better driving environments near schools, residential areas, and construction zones.

## Methodology

1. **First Stripe (Speed Calculation)**:
   - A scanning system detects and calculates the vehicle's speed when crossing the first stripe.
   
2. **Second Stripe (Road Surface Scanning)**:
   - Identifies violations (e.g., speeding) and processes penalties using RFID systems.

3. **Third Stripe (Speed Reduction)**:
   - Activates the vehicle's speed reduction mechanisms, such as braking systems or engine adjustments.

4. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - Involves evaluating traffic volume, accident history, and proximity to sensitive zones for optimized placement.

5. **Design and Implementation**:
   - Utilizes radar sensors, RFID systems, and appropriate markings for effective functionality.
